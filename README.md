TODO:
- make "move index" consistent everywhere on the page
- bar chart legend
- change color of "State" button
- add autofocus to lead user to hover over "State" button
- define move index more clearly
- sizing stuff to fit the map and div on the screen?
- radio buttons for bubble thing
- data filter for donut chart to only get counties with certain state queried

- slide with bubbles currently makes the map over it, fix this so that slide only changes existing SVG (map or bubbles) - maybe a bool?
- toggle back and forth between map and bubbles
